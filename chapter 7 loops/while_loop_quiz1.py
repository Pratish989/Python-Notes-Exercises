# write a program to print 1 to 50 using a while loop
# i = 0 
# while i < 51:
    # print(str(i))
    # i = i + 1  # command diya to add 1 no. so it adds the previous one. 

# loop jab tak false nhi huyi tb tak chal rhi thi 


#ACTUALCODE 
# i = 1 
# while i <=50:
#     print(str(i))
#     i = i + 1  

# pehle vale me 0 bhi aa raha hai means total 51 digits ho rhe hai 


# 2nd example - print harry five times


# i = 1 
# while i <= 5:
#     print("harry")
#     i = i + 1





# 3rd example 
# write a program to print the contents of a list using while loop 

i = 0
while i < len(list): # i was searching for index of an list but len is used here
    print(list[i])
    i = i + 1
