# Q1 Add two numbers 
# a = 345
# b = 878
# print ("addition of a and b is :", a + b)


# Q2 Write a Python program to find the remainder when a number is divided by Z(Integer)
# a = input(" enter any no.")
# a = int(a)

# z = input ("enter another no.")
# z = int(z)

# print ("remainder of a to z is ", a%z)
# print(a%z)




# Q3 Check the type of the variable assigned using the input() function

# a = input ("enter anything ") # everything in double quote is string 

# #a = float(a)
# print(type(a))





# Q4 Use a comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than b or not. (Take a=34 and b=80)

# a = 34
# b = 80
# c = (a>b)
# print(c )




# Q5 Write a Python program to find the average of two numbers entered by the user

# a = input("enter no1. ")
# a = int(a)
# b = input("enter no2. ")
# b = int(b)

# print ("average value of two nos. is  " )
# print((a+b)/2)




# Q6 Write a Python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

# a = input ("enter  any no. ")
# # here the entered value is string, so there cant be any sqaure of string value so now we have to 
# #convert this string to integer, and how can we do it? typecasting
# a =int(a)
# print("square of no is ", a*a)
